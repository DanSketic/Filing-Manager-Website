Graviton stores plugins in a _automatically_ created folder, this one is called '.graviton2'.

Default location for every OS:

| OS            | Location                                                        |
| ------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows       | C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\\.graviton2                   |
| Linux         | /home/UserName/.config/.graviton2                               |
| MacOS         | /Users/UserName/Library/Application Support/.graviton2          |

This path can be changed in the setting: `appConfigPath`

Plugins are located in `.graviton2/plugins`.
