An Editor Client is the component created to display a file inside a tab. 

##### Examples:
* The CodeMirror client (built-in), is used to display a CodeMirror (text editor) instance when you open a plain text file. 
* The Image Viewer (built-in too), is used to display image files.

The Editor Client is just an API that connects Graviton and the code behind the editor client. This allows Graviton to have a more scalable architecture.
