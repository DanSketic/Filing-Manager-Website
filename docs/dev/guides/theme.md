## Overview

If you read the file `package.json` you will see a tons of properties:

| `id`          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Plugin's id (no spaces)                                    |
| `author`      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Author's name                                              |

| `type`        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Type of the plugin, in this case 'theme'                   |
| `colorsScheme`&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Scheme of the differents components and it's colors        |

**Note**: This template is based on built-in Graviton's Arctic theme.


## Developing

You can now modify the properties under colorsScheme.

To use a custom [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html) theme you must specify it's file name in `fileTheme`.

For easier developement you can open a debug window from `"Window" > "Debug" > "Open debug window"` and then reload it each time you make a change.

Or you can also open Graviton in developement mode from the source code (see https://github.com/Graviton-Code-Editor/Graviton-App/blob/master/BUILDING.md#desktop)
